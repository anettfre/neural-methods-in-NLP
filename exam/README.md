To run code: First run wsi.py for Amrami/Goldberg 2019.

To get ARI score run compare_and_ari.py. Compare_and_ari.py uses eval.py.

This sorts the scores and compare clusters in gold and pred to assign senses to gold that would correspond to pred. Then it calculates an ARI score for each word, and the average of the ARI scores over all words.
